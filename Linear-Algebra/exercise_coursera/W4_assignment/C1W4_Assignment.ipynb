    "As you learned in the lectures, eigenvalues and eigenvectors play a very important role in what's called (discrete) dynamical systems. As you might recall, a **discrete dynamical system** descibes a system where, as time goes by, the state changes according to some process. When defining this dynamical systems you could represent all the possible states, such as sunny, rainy or cloudy, in a vector called the **state vector**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each discrete dynamical system can me represented by a transition matrix $P$, which indicates, given a particular state, what are the chances or probabilities of moving to each of the other states. This means the element $(2,1)$ of the matrix represents the probability of transitioning from state $1$ to state $2$.\n",
    " \n",
    "Starting with an initial state $X_0$, the transition to the next state $X_1$ is a linear transformation defined by the transition matrix $P$: $X_1=PX_0$. That leads to $X_2=PX_1=P^2X_0$, $X_3=P^3X_0$, and so on. This implies that $X_t=PX_{t-1}$ for $t=0,1,2,3,\\ldots$. In other words, we can keep multiplying by `P` to move from one state to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "One application of discrete dynamical systems is to model browsing web pages. Web pages often contain links to other pages, so the dynamical system would model how a user goes from one page to another by hopping from link to link. For simplicity, assume that the browser is only following links to a new page rather than navigating to an unlinked one. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the state vector $X_t$ will be the probabilities that the browser is on a particular page at time $t$. Navigation from one page to another advances the model from one state vector $X_{t-1}$ to another state vector $X_t$. A linear transformation, defined by a matrix $P$, will have entries $p_{ij}$ with the probabilities that the browser navigates to page $j$ from page $i$. For fixed column $j$, the entries represent a probability distribution describing location of the browser at the next step, given that you are at state $j$. Thus, the entries in each column must add to 1."
